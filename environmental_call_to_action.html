			<h2>What is Light Pollution?</h2>
			<p class="dropdownya">Light pollution is the result of modern-day light coming from street lamps, buildings, homes, etc. that lights up our skies. It is now harder and harder to see the stars in our sky from the naked eye, and this issue is only getting worse. It has large effects on human circadian rhythms and animals’ abilities to tell when it is nighttime.</p>

			<h2>Facts</h2>
			<ul class="dropdownya" style="list-style-type: square;">
				<li>More than 80% of people live under “skyglow”, the glow of light pollution</li>
				<li>Only 40% of stars seen today will be seen in 18 years</li>
				<li>Humans produce melatonin when it is dark, and in blue-light, melatonin does not produce</li>
				<li>Light pollution is largely affecting animals and their migration patterns and habitat formation, ruining many animals’ way of life</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li class="dropdown">
			<h2>What can we do?</h2>
			<ul class="dropdownya" style="list-style-type: square;">
				<li>Some cities have implemented a “Lights Out” program that turns off building lights while birds are migrating</li>
				<li>Organizations like the IDA (International Dark Sky Association) has 13 dark sky reserves around the world</li>
				<li>Control our outdoor lighting and keep light inside buildings and homes at night</li>
