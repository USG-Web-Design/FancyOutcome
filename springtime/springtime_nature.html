			<h2 class="div1">#1 University of Washington's Cherry Blossoms
			<p>Located right on the UW campus, visit a flower-filled quad! These Yoshino trees are almost 90 years old and bring thousands of visitors to campus every year! The trees usually are the most beautiful in late March, but blossoms can be seen between February and May. Did you know? Most trees people think are cherry trees are actually plum trees. Thankfully the UW trees are real cherry trees :)</p> </h2>

			<h2 class="div2">#2 Hike to Lake Serene
			<p> Lake Serene is a beautiful mountain hike, so bring all of your friends, family and pets! You may need to practice on some easier hikes beforehand, since a round trip to Lake Serene is sbout 7.2 miles, but it will definitely be worth it. If the weather is nice enough, you can even jump into the lake at the top of the mountain! </p> </h2>
